## Problem and Design Overview

{/* A ProjectImageBlock displays text with an associated image.
  * - The image is configured through properties on the opening `ProjectImageBlock` tag.
  * - Text is placed within the opening and closing `ProjectImageBlock` tags.
  * - In a small browser window, the image will be rendered below the text.
  * - In a large browser window, the image will be rendered on the right.
  *
  * - The width property controls how much of the grid is assigned to the image column.
  *   Values can be 4 (the smallest image), 6 (half the width of the page), or 8 (the largest image).
  *
  * - The maxHeight property controls the rendered height of an image.
  *   Although the image here is 1200x800, maxHeight limits its rendered height to 400px.
  *   If not specified, the default maxHeight is 400px.
  *
  * Later in the template you will also find examples of the plural `ProjectImagesBlock` tag.

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: cel,
        alt: "A picture of a check engine light on a car dashboard."
    }}
    caption={
        "Depicts a check engine light which tells a car owner that something is amiss with their car maintenance"
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"500px"}

Cars are a part of many people's everyday lives and should be well-maintained to 
keep us safe. However, many car owners know little to none about how they should 
upkeep their cars. Because of this, they must rely on repair shops to tell them what 
services they need to get done, often leading them to be upsold on unnecessary services. 
Experiences such as those can lead to financial strain and eventually contribute to the negligence of vehicle maintenance as trust between the car owner and mechanic wanes. 

Our design aims to rebuild that trust and give car owners more control over their car 
maintenance by giving them an easy way to track needed services and service history 
while filling in education gaps about such services.


</ProjectImageBlock>

## Design Research Process and Key Insights

To gain a better understanding of consumers's wants in a maintenance-tracking app 
our team interviewed an assortment of both potential users and stakeholders.

We conducted three interviews with:
<ol>
  <li>
  a college student who regularly drives his car a few times a week. 
  He finds himself at the mechanic often due to his car being old. He does not have any
  knowledge about car maintenance.
  </li>
  <li>
  another college student who drives his car daily. He considers himself knowledgeable 
  about cars and does a lot of maintenance at home as he does not want to rely on 
  trusting repair shops.
  </li>
  <li>
  a person who drives a couple of hundred miles a week and follows the maintenance schedule 
  from his vehicle's manual. He has a strong distrust of maintenance shops.
  </li>
</ol>

### Need for Transparency

All three of our interviewees expressed distrust in repair shops, two of which mentioned 
that though they distrust them, they have little choice but to use them. This is because 
the only other option is learning how to maintain their car themself. Through our interviews 
it was expressed that the lack of trust stemmed from the fact that the repair shops have 
all the power in the situation to play up the severity of a service needed or to simply add 
a service that is unnecessary or repetitive unbeknownst to the car owner. Because of this, 
we noticed a trend that car owners want more transparency in regard to their car service 
history when dealing with repair shops.


### A Want to Understand

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: info,
            alt: "The AutoPilot apps function to reveal information about a service.",
            caption: "The AutoPilot app lets users see information regarding services.",
        },
        {
            src: receipt,
            alt: "A picture of a recipt with verry expensive charges.",
            caption: "Service costs add up very fast.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"500px"}
>

Our research revealed a want from car owners to be able to understand what services they need for 
their cars and why. It is easy to see that a light is flashing on the dashboard, thus indicating 
a need for a service, but without research on their own, they do not know what it means. This goes 
for services listed at the repair shop as well. A mechanic tells the owner what services they need, 
they sometimes explain what exactly that means in terms of what physically needs to be done, but 
rarely without prompting explain why this service must take place. Understanding why a service needs 
to take place would greatly ease the worries of car owners and build trust between them and mechanics 
according to our interviewees.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Need for Financial Preparation 

Another key insight focused on the users' need for financial preparation. Participants expressed anxiety over 
unexpected costs associated with vehicle maintenance. Being able to see how much their future services 
will cost to plan financially would be very helpful. 
Additionally, when comparing which services are urgent and which can wait, a novice in car maintenance would not 
know how they stack up against each other. Through our research, the recurring theme of wanting to 
know how to prioritize services kept reappearing. The interviewees shared that a lot of time, they need 
to decline services because of finances and would love to know which to prioritize without sacrificing 
car safety.

## Iterative Design Process and Key Insights

In our iterative design process for Assignment 3, we focused on enhancing the user experience for vehicle 
maintenance tasks through a series of steps: beginning with paper prototyping, followed by user testing, 
heuristic evaluation, and culminating in the creation of a digital mockup. Our design focus was on improving 
the interface for selecting vehicle mileage for future service, reorganizing the menu bar for consistency with 
platform norms, and ensuring users had a clear path for task execution through better navigation and documentation. 
This process was aimed at refining our app's usability and interface to better meet user needs and expectations.

With this, the concept of our paper prototype was to create an easy experience for users to check for future and 
current car services. Through our iterative process we found the following to be our biggest insights on our design.

### Simplifying the Selection Process

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: before1,
            alt: "Before image of the scrolling mileage bar.",
        },
        {
            src: after1,
            alt: "After image of the newly improved mileage bar with the three dots.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "Before and after images of the paper prototype mileage bar."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Our initial design included a top scroll bar for selecting vehicle mileage, which was confusing 
for users. Feedback from user testing indicated that participants struggled with this feature, 
finding it unintuitive. Based on this, we iterated to a more modern and familiar approach, using a 
"..." button to reveal more options for mileage intervals. This change was directly informed by the 
confusion observed during user testing, leading to a simpler, more accessible way for users to navigate 
through their service options.


</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Enhancing Interface Consistency

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: before3,
            alt: "Before image of the menu bar without the home icon",
        },
        {
            src: after2,
            alt: "After image of the menu bar with a home icon.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"column"}
    caption={
        "Before and after images of the paper prototype menu bar."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

From our first evaluation, it was noted that there was no way to return back to the home page due 
to an absence of a home button. In further iterations of the design, a home button was added however, 
the positioning of menu icons and buttons in to new paper prototype showed inconsistencies 
with common app layouts, as identified during our initial user testing phase. 

Participants noted that the placement of the menu button and icons did not align with their expectations, based on 
their experience with other apps (which commonly place the home button in the center or front of the row). In response, 
we reorganized the menu bar, placing the home button 
on the far left and the alert button on the far right, aligning our design more closely with platform 
norms and improving user navigation intuitiveness.

### Improving Navigation and Documentation

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: before2,
            alt: "Before image of the alert with no tooltip.",
        },
        {
            src: after3,
            alt: "After image of the alert with a tooltip.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "Before and after images of the paper prototype"
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Feedback from heuristic evaluation highlighted the absence of a back button and sufficient documentation, 
which could hinder users from understanding how to complete tasks within the app. To address this, 
we introduced pop-up instructions on various screens to guide users through the app's functionality 
and added a back button to improve navigation. This iteration was crucial for ensuring users felt supported 
and could easily navigate the app, significantly enhancing the user experience.

## Resulting Design

AutoPilot finalized its design as a mobile application, creating a seamless user experience in 
self-tracking user car services. Using this platform allows for dynamic tracking in users' log 
services, maintaining detailed records, and planning future maintenance conveniently right from 
the palm of their hand. This ensures vehicles remain in optimal condition, promoting longevity 
and safety effectively while also strengthening the customer-mechanic relationship with essential 
insights into the vehicle services preventing any unnecessary upselling, misguidance, and inconsistencies. 

### Task 1: Searching and Planning for Future Services

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: task1,
        alt: "Images of the future services page showing how to change the estimated costs.",
    }}
    caption={
        "Images of the future services page."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>
This task was designed to tackle our research findings about the need to plan out finances. In being able to 
look up their future services and costs, one can prepare better for future finances.

From the home page of the mobile application, the user can access the future services page on the navigation bar. 
The page grants them the ability to see all of the services that are needed at each mileage milestone. By navigating 
to their desired mileage milestone, by selecting their desired services. The estimated cost will be updated, which 
allows for financial planning to be prepared when the milestone is reached. 

</ProjectImageBlock>

### Task 2: Looking Up Current Services and Service History

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: task21,
            alt: "Progression from the home page to the alert page",
            caption: "Within a specified range from the next service mileage milestone. Upon opening the application, the home page will prompt an alert for upcoming vehicle maintenance. Navigating to the alerts page prompts exactly what needs to be done."
        },
        {
            src: task22,
            alt: "Progression of the application from alert page with one service checked, to confirmation page, to history page",
            caption: "When the service is completed, navigate back to the alerts page marking and confirming the task will fulfill the services due. To ensure the task has been tracked, navigate to the service history page and confirm the completed update."
        },
    ]}
    direction={"column"}
    width={100}
    maxHeight={"500"}
>

This task goal is to allow users the agency to track what services they need to complete and services they've completed into their own hands. 
By allowing them to manually check off completed services, the application broadens it's users to not only people 
who use repair shops, but also people who do home repairs.
